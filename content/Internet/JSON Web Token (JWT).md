```
🔓 Login → verify username/password → generate JWT
📨 Client stores JWT (local storage / mobile ke shared prefs)
🔐 Every API call → sends JWT in "Authorization" header
✅ Server checks JWT → agar valid hai → allow access

```


## without JWT
- we need user name and password for every request and verify for each request .

## with JWT
- can be used for authentication and authroization
