A **port** is just a **16-bit unsigned number** defined in the TCP/UDP header. It exists:
- So that multiple applications can share the same IP address
- TCP and UDP headers use **16 bits** to represent the port.
- 2¹⁶ = 65,536 possible values → **0 to 65535**.

No, not without **changing the entire TCP/IP protocol** — which would break compatibility with everything on the Internet.

To expand ports beyond 65535:
- we’d need a new protocol (e.g., TCPv2).
- Every router, OS, firewall, and browser would need to support it.

- Each app can **bind** to a port, and no two apps can bind to the same port+IP at the same time.
- So it feels like a **resource** you can reserve or occupy.
- Also, **well-known ports** (0–1023) are reserved for system services (HTTP = 80, SSH = 22, etc.), giving them special meaning.
