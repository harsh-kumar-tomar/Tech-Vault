# Tips

1. solving a prob >>>>>>>> implementation of problem 
as implemention involves programming , but it is not much important if you just crack the idea behind the prob , which is more important as implementation is just optional than .

2. every prob is a mathematical problem
many topics and problems in CP are mathematical , things in terms of that . Rather than typical ds.

3. 80 >>>>>>>>>>>>20
solving and understanding 80 percent problem is much important that solving the ramaining  niche 20 percent prob.
