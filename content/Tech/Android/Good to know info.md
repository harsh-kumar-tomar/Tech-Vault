# Reference
A _reference_ is information about the location of an object. A reference is stored in the **stack memory** and the actual object is stored in the **Heap** memory of the JVM.

In Java, there are four types of references. Each reference types differentiate the way by which they are garbage collected.

1. Strong ref : normal objects
2. weak ref : removed when we needed 
3. soft ref: removed with there is no enough emmoey 
4. phantom ref
