[[Android]]

The **Dialog** class is the base class for dialogs, but don't instantiate `Dialog` directly. Instead, use one of the following subclasses:
1. Alert Dialog (imp.)
2. DatePickerDialog or TimePickerDialog 
3. ProgressDialog (But depreciated )



## Alert Dialog

**intro**
the `DialogFragment` class provides all the controls we  need to create our dialog and manage its appearance, instead of calling methods on the `Dialog` object.



## Method

onCreateDialog
