It is used to find the shortest path from one vertex to all other vertex in a [[Tech/Dsa/Graph/Graph|Graph]].
It is based based on #greedy apporach rather than dp , as dp usually follows a fixed order (like iterating from 0 to n ), but Dijkstra picks the next node dynamically based on the minimum distance.
