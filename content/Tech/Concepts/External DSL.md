A completely separate language with its own syntax  specific to a domain. It requires its own tooling (compiler/interpreter).

eg [[_SQL]] for databases

json a data storing format f
regex for mathing pattern
markdown files for writing data
html and css for structure and styling 


[[json]] : it does not comes under hosting language javascript ([[Internal DSL]]) . It is inspired by javascript syntax eg

```
{ key : value }
```

so it is not tied to javascript anymore , but now it exists as an independent concept of storing data understood by almost every programming language .
